# Intruder-Detectio-System
An Intruder Detection System (IDS) monitors networks or systems to spot unauthorized access or malicious behavior. GitHub hosts IDS tools like Suricata, Teler, and ML-based systems using Python. You can build one with OpenCV, Datetime, NumPy, and face recognition to send alerts.
